sudo dnf install -y \
	ansible-core 

on each client, create a conf user (i do this by default) that's a member of the wheel group
we will also permit the ansible user to NOPASSWD sudo, so.. this account essentially has root
on every machine.

groupadd -g 1000 conf
useradd -u1000 -g1000 -Gwheel -s/bin/bash -m conf

echo "conf ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers/conf

on the ansible server as "conf" we will ship our ssh keys to each node as conf
1. generate the keys as conf on the ansible node
ssh-keygen -ted25519

2. ship the keys to each node so that the ansible node can authenticate and be admin on them.
ssh-copy-id node_$x


3. on the ansible server:
mkdir ~/automation
cd ~/automation
echo this to ./ansible.cfg
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
host_key_checking = false
remote_user = conf
ask_pass = False

[privilege_escalation]
become=true
become_method=sudo
become_user=root
become_ask_pass=False

4. now create an inventory file in ~/automation/inventory with the contents like so:
[scratch]
scratch-arm-0

[docker]
docker-arm-0
docker-arm-1
docker-arm-2

[nfs]
nfs-arm-0

[ansible]
ansible-arm-0


5. put all of the hosts in the inventory file. now run
ansible all -m ping
